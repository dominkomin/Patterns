Used commonly in multi-threaded code
- easy to implement since the code for producer and consumer is independent from each other (they just need to know about a shared object)
- the producer does not need to know about the consumer; the same applies to the consumer
- producer and consumer can work with different speed
- separation of producer and consumer functionality result inmore readable and manageable code
