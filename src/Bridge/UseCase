It is a structural pattern
- It decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that they two can vary independently
It is used when both the class as well as what it does vary often:
- encapsulate what varies
- Favor aggregation over class inheritance
- inheritance is still there!
- do not use inheritance to combine across dimensions of variation
