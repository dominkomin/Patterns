It is a structural design pattern
- It provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a collection of subsystems: defines a higher-level interface that
makes the subsystems easier to use
- Subsystems are built for multiple client applications but most applications use only a small subset
- façade simplifies a process for most clients
- The number of dependencies between a client and the implementation classes is large
- façade reduces the number of dependencies by providing an interface that allows a level of isolation between them
