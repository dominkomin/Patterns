It is a behavioral pattern
- The intent of the pattern is to give more than one object the opportunity to handle a request by linking receiving
objects together
- It allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request, independently of any other object along the chain
- “handle or forward” model
- The pattern is applied when more than one object may handle a request, and the handler is not known in advance
