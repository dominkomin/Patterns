It is a behavioral pattern
- It provide an object, the null object, as a surrogate for the lack ofan object of a certain type
- the null object provides a do nothing behavior to avoid special if blocks
- the client is not aware if the real object or the null object is called so the if section is removed from client implementation

The NullObject class is often implemented as a singleton
- The null object pattern can be used with the factory pattern
- the concrete class returned from a factory can be a real object or a null object
- The null object pattern can be used with the template method pattern
- a NullObject can be use to implement a concrete template that does nothing
- Examples of null objects in the JDK can be found in the package java.util.Collections with methods emptyList(),emptyMap(), and emptySet()
