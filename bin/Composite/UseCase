- A composite is an object composed of either individual
items or other composites or a mix thereof
- composites are objects that can hold themselves
- Example: a drawing is a composite being composed of
graphic primitives, like lines, rectangles, circles, etc.
- each graphic primitive can be drawn, moved, and resized; the
same operations can also be performed on the composite
- manipulation of both primitive objects and composite objects
in exactly the same way, without distinguishing between the
them, simplifies code implementation and maintenance
- In Java, GUI layout is an example of a composite
- a panel may contain other panels each containing many widgets

It is a structural pattern
- It allows to compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies and lets clients treat
individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly
- It defines class hierarchies consisting of primitive objects
and composite objects
- primitive objects can be composed into more complex objects,
which in turn can be composed
- Every element in the structure (primitive and composite
objects) operates with a uniform interface
- adding new components is easy and client code remains
unchanged 

The composite design pattern lets you treat primitive and
composite objects exactly the same way; this also
happens in other frameworks and domains
- the Apache Struts framework includes Tiles, a JSP tag library,
that allows to compose a Web page from multiple JSPs
- the Java GUI layout and widgets
- the JUnit 3.x is a testing framework for Java (www.junit.org)
