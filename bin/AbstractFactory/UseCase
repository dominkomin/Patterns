It is a creational pattern

It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

With the factory method pattern, a factory can create different objects at run time
- An object is responsible for creating things for a client to use

With the abstract factory pattern one interface is used for creating different products
- clients get and use an instance of the abstract factory object to create products
- clients are decoupled from the actual concrete products returned by each factory
