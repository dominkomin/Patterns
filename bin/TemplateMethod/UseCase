- It is a behavioral pattern
- It defines the skeleton of an algorithm as sequence of methods and defers some steps for subclasses to implement
- A template method that implements the algorithm is defined in a base class while the implementation of the specialized
steps is deferred for other classes to redefine
- certain common steps are defined in a base class
- The specialized steps are
- declared as abstract methods
- overridden by subclasses to allow different behaviors
