- It is a behavioral pattern
- This pattern allows an object to alter its behavior whenits internal state changes
- It encapsulates all behavior of a state into an object
- Similar to the strategy pattern:
- with the state pattern changes happen at runtime
- with the strategy pattern the client decides what behavior to select
