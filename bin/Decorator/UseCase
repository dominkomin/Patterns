It is a structural pattern
- It makes it possible to modify the behavior of individual objects at runtime without having to create
a new derived class
- The decorator is an object that modifies the behavior of, or adds features to another object
- features added to a simple object without disrupting its interface
- Start with a simple object with basic functionalities and later “wrap/decorate” it with more capabilities
through composition and delegation
